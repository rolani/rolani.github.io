# Welcome to my engineering blog

Thanks for visiting.

I created this space to share practical lessons from building cloud and platform systems, especially around:

- Kubernetes operations and reliability patterns
- Infrastructure automation with Terraform and GitOps
- Observability, incident response, and SLO design
- AI and data infrastructure scaling trade-offs

More posts coming soon.
